# SterlingSaysGame

## A version of the classic Simon Says Game that can be played on the toilet to pass the time.

Notes:
1) It can be played be either pressing the buttons or using the q, w, a, s, keys on a keyboard
2) It will record your best run for that session and maintain it as long as the site is not reloaded. There is no backend so it will not store it beyond this.
3) Unlike other version of the game Sterling (Simon), will repeat all his steps for you, as opposed to only giving you his next button each time. I thought this was more enjoyable, and more fun to code.
4) Enjoy!
